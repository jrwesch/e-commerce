## Description
This assignment is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. In doing so the designer will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

The user will need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. If installing through the terminal please ensure you install inquirer version 8.2.4 (npm i inquirer@8.2.4)
